# Today I Learned

Every day we learn something, whether we like it or not. Sometimes the knowledge disappears as quickly as it is obtained.

This repo is a personal collection of what I've learnt on any given day. Whilst the collection is mostly personal, I keep it public in hopes to benefit others.
